<h2 style="color: blue;">Installation</h2>
<b>Unzip Files & Open</b>
<ol><li>Unzip the callcount.zip file into your Downloads folder on Windows, or unzip and copy all files to your Downloads folder.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Open the <a href="callcount.html">callcount.html</a> file (from your Downloads folder) in your web browser.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="color: blue;">Basic Usage</h2>
<b>Date</b> will automatically load today's date and will become the first part of the save file.  Date can be changed by clicking 'change' link.<br /><br />
<b>Add Calls or Transfers</b> by clicking the big + button next to each.  Or, remove a call or transfer using the - button.<br /><br />
<b>Hours</b> worked and Pause time can be manually entered.<br /><br />
<b>To save daily stats</b>, click the Save Daily Stats button.  This will immediately download a file into your Downloads folder.  You will need to move this file into it's own folder where you'll save all the daily logs.  I recommend just using the accompanying batch program (move_logs.bat) from your Downloads folder, which will move logs into the "ACS Logs" folder under your Downloads folder.  This will be useful if you want to use the included spreadsheet importer.  Simply double-click the move_logs.bat file in your Downloads folder and all logs will be moved to the ACS Logs folder for you.<br /><br />
<h2 style="color: blue;">Moving Logs</h2>
To move all the logs into the same folder for saving and later import to the spreadsheet, manually move them from your Downloads folder into their own folder, or use the move_logs.bat program.  Simply copy the move_logs.bat file into your Downloads folder.  Then, anytime you have downloaded logs, just run the move_logs.bat file and it will create the 'ACS Logs' folder and move all the logs there automatically.<br /><br />
<h2 style="color: blue;">Importing Logs to Spreadsheet</h2>
The final part of this tool is the ability to import all the logs into a spreadsheet for tracking, calculation, and more!  The Excel spreadsheet included (Excel-Merge-Logs.xlsm) imports the logs from their csv format into a spreadsheet for a complete and centralized location to track your work.  Using the spreadsheet, you can merge downloaded logs automatically and use Excel to calculate total hours, calls, and transfers.<br /><br />
Just open the Excel file and enable Macros or Trust the file, then press CTRL-M to start (or follow the instructions provided).<br /><br />
You will be asked for the folder containing the ACS Logs - if you have set things up properly and used the move_logs.bat program, the logs will all be in your Downloads folder under ACS Logs.  Otherwise, select whatever folder to which you saved them.<br /><br />
The logs will be merged and moved into a folder named <i>merged</i> to prevent duplicates.  The popup will tell you where the file is saved, usually under your Documents folder in Windows.  You can then open the file and manipulate the data to your liking, adding the ability to automatically total the columns like Calls and Hours.  Using the created Excel file, you can also create charts and graphs using the data, calculate your estimated paycheck, and more!<br /><br />
<b>Recommended</b> to only run the spreadsheet importer once a week or month to capture either your weekly or monthly stats, as you prefer.  Running the spreadsheet macro more often will not be beneficial as only a short reporting time will be considered.<br /><br /><br /><br />
